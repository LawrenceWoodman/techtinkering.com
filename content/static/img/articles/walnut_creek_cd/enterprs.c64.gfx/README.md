# .RLE Image Files

The images in this directory were contained within the following directory on the [Walnut Creek CD](http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/ftp.php?b=cpm/Software/WalnutCD/).
* [/enterprs/c64/gfx/](http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/ftp.php?b=cpm/Software/WalnutCD/enterprs/c64/gfx/).

The .RLE files were converted to .PBM files using _cistopbm_ and then converted to .PNG using _gThumb_.

The .CBM files were displayed on a C64 using _cslide_ and then the screens were captured to .PNG files.

The copyright remains with the original owners and I make no claim to them.  They are contained here as they have been freely available via the Walnut Creek CD for over 20 years.
