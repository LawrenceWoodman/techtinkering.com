There are lots of different programming challenges, but this year one in particular has caught my attention and I have decided to take part.  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) starts 1st December with daily programming puzzles throughout [advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent).

To make this challenge a little more interesting I have decided to do the 25 puzzles in 25 different programming languages.  This will be interesting as while I have used quite a lot of different languages, I don't know 25 well.  I'm also have quite limited time in the run up to Christmas.  Therefore, I'm going to solve each puzzle first in Tcl and then create a second version in another language that gives the same result.  Tcl is one of my favourite languages so the code should be reasonably good.

I am putting my solutions in a [repo](https://github.com/lawrencewoodman/adventofcode) on GitHub.

## Day 1: Chronal Calibration

To ease myself in gradually the [day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1) puzzle has been done with [Tcl](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) alone.

## Day 2: Inventory Management System

For [day2](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2) I have chosen [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).  I used to use ruby quite a lot at one time, but was surprised how much I had forgotten.  The code is probably not very idiomatic, but it wasn't too hard to convert the Tcl solution over to ruby.
