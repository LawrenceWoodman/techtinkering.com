        <description><![CDATA[The premise of this book is that the 60s/70s counter-culture led to the personal computer revolution. I think the book demonstrated well how this influenced SAIL and how the Augment lab innovations led to the work at Xerox on the Alto and in turn became an influence for Apple and Microsoft.

        <description><![CDATA[Geary is a lightweight email client inspired by gmail's interface.

        <pubDate>19 Apr 2014 00:00:01 BST</pubDate>
        <description><![CDATA[With F#, the list often feels like the default choice of data structure.  It is immutable and hence easy to reason about, however its use can come at a great cost.  If you are using lists to process large amounts of data, then a lot of time will be spent creating objects and garbage collecting.  ...]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Programmable or reconfigurable character sets were a simple alternative to fully bitmappable displays.  The main driving force behind their creation was a desire to keep the cost of computers low: RAM was expensive and bitmappable displays need more complex hardware.

        <description><![CDATA[BBS Ads were important to users and sysops of BBS's.  There wasn't any universal directory like the phone book, and during the heyday of BBS's (early '80s to the mid '90s), most people couldn't easily access the Internet.

        <description><![CDATA[CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I'm not alone.

        <description><![CDATA[To do any serious programming under CP/M, the first thing you need is a good programmers editor.  There aren't many in the archives, but I have tried most of them and found ZDE to be the best.

        <description><![CDATA[I have decided to try out some old CP/M software, but need something to run it on.&nbsp; I could either do this on my Commodore 128 or through emulation.&nbsp; Unfortunately the 1571 disk drive for my Commodore is currently out of action, so that leaves me with emulation.&nbsp; I was going to use...]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[I watched 'Three Days of the Condor' the other night and loved seeing what I believe is a Dec PDP 8/E being used.  Also featured in connection with this machine was a DecWriter, paper tape reader and possibly a VT-52 video terminal.

The film revolves around a CIA researcher, Robert Redford, find...]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[It was fascinating to read this book from 1979 and see how operating system design was viewed then, compared to now.  The biggest change being the shift in importance from batch processing to the interactive use of computers.  Despite the advances since this book was written, it is surprising how...]]></description>
