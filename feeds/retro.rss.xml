          <description><![CDATA[The premise of this book is that the 60s/70s counter-culture led to the personal computer revolution. I think the book demonstrated well how this influenced SAIL and how the Augment lab innovations led to the work at Xerox on the Alto and in turn became an influence for Apple and Microsoft.

          <description><![CDATA[Programmable or reconfigurable character sets were a simple alternative to fully bitmappable displays.  The main driving force behind their creation was a desire to keep the cost of computers low: RAM was expensive and bitmappable displays need more complex hardware.  Programmable character sets ...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[To make machine language programs more friendly it is nice to add a basic stub which contains a line with a SYS statement to start the code.  This is easy to do on the Vic-20 and the process gives you an insight into how Basic programs are stored in memory.  I’ll show you how to do this and how t...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[BBS Ads were important to users and sysops of BBS’s.  There wasn’t any universal directory like the phone book, and during the heyday of BBS’s (early ’80s to the mid ’90s), most people couldn’t easily access the Internet.  Every BBS had a different atmosphere.  It was important to attract users a...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[The Commodore Vic-20 is a great machine to learn an assembly language on.  It was released in 1981 and was the first computer to sell one million units, which contributes to its popularity today.  The machine is well documented, well supported through forums and much of the hardware is plentiful ...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[Most BBSs that are still running now do so via telnet.  In many ways this is great as it allows people from all around the world to access a BBS as if it were local to them.  The problem comes though, when you want to upload or download a file to/from the BBS.  Most telnet clients don’t make this...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[I have written previously about why Turbo Pascal is a Great Choice For Programming Under CP/M and now it is time to talk about what could have been.  You probably haven’t heard of Turbo Modula-2 for CP/M as it was only on the market for a brief period of time.  However, it was a superb product an...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I’m not alone.  When Turbo Pascal was released in 1983 by Borland, as their first software development application, it was quickly adopted by school...]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[I have often noticed programmers getting worked up about the legacy code they are maintaining.  I know it is annoying having to wade through poor code, or
worrying about making changes for fear of unexpected side-effects.  However, it is important to see the code for what it is and in the context...]]></description>
